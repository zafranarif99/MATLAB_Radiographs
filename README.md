# MATLAB_Radiographs

The goal of this project is an analysis of the left-inverse process on the radiographic data. In this project you will use the ideas of injectivity, left-inverse, digonalizability, eigenvalues,
inner product, and norm. This project has a significant computational aspect, though complicated code
development is not necessary.
